basic soundfont example
=======================

This example shows how you can load soundfonts into the browser either locally or remotely and then use them to play a few notes.

Building
--------

From the current directory

    $ bower install
    $ ./build.sh

The code is built as example.js in the basic/dist directory. This is runnable if you open the corresponding index.html.  The local grand piano soundfont is also located here.
